Prototype-specific packages such as [vdcoldbox](https://github.com/dladams/vdcoldbox/)
on how to identify event data files of interest, e.g. for a particular run or time period
and those results are expressed in terms of *datasets* which are list of logical file names.
The convention in this package ([duneproc](https://github.com/dladams/duneproc)) is to
search the directory tree $HOME/data/dune/datasets for a file named \<dsname>.txt that
holds the list of file names for dataset \<dsname>.
